# Data Engineering & Cloud Computing Roadmap 🚀🌱

Hey there! Welcome to my **Data Engineering** & **Cloud Computing Roadmap**! 🌱 This site is your go-to guide for all things **Data Engineering** and **Cloud Computing**. It’s a super fun and interactive way to learn, with resources to help you out at each stage, and a simple way to track your progress. 📈

Let’s level up those tech skills! 💻✨

## What’s Inside? 🧐

- **Interactive Roadmap**: Scroll through stages, from beginner to advanced topics. Think of it as a treasure map, but for your tech journey! 🗺️✨
- **Progress Tracker**: Tick off each stage once you’re done, and watch it change color! ✅ Each completed stage will go dark as a reminder of your awesomeness. 💪
- **Free Learning Resources**: I’ve gathered all the free resources you need (courses, docs, videos, etc.) for each topic, so you can learn at your own pace! 📚🎓
- **Hero Section**: A stylish welcome section with a **green gradient** 🌿, because who doesn't love a bit of color to start the day? 🌞
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Whether you’re on your laptop 💻, phone 📱, or tablet 📲, you can access this roadmap from anywhere, anytime.
- **Hover Effects**: Get ready for smooth hover animations! Watch the links and sections react when you hover over them – it’s like magic! ✨✨
- **And More**: Trust me, there’s a lot more hidden inside this site that’ll make your learning journey fun! 😁

## Tech Stuff 🛠️

- **Frontend**: React.js 🚀 (because it’s fast and awesome!)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with some cool hover effects and transitions 🌈
- **State Management**: React’s `useState` to keep track of your progress ✅
- **Hosting**: Static site platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify 🚀 (Super easy to set up!)

## How to Run It Locally 👨‍💻👩‍💻

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-engineering-cloud-roadmap.git
```

2. **Go to the project folder**:

```bash
cd data-engineering-cloud-roadmap
```

3. **Install dependencies** (let’s get everything set up):

```bash
npm install

## Roadmap Stages 🌱🌍

- **Stage 1: Core Foundations**: Time to learn **Python** 🐍 and get comfy with **SQL** & **databases** (trust me, this is the foundation of EVERYTHING!). 💾
- **Stage 2: Data Engineering Basics**: Learn how to manipulate data (with **Pandas** 🐼), build **ETL pipelines**, and control your code with **Git** & **GitHub**. 🛠️
- **Stage 3: Cloud & Big Data Tools**: Time to get your head around **cloud platforms** like **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, and **Azure** 🌥️. Dive into big data tools like **Apache Spark** and **Hadoop**. ☁️
- **Stage 4: Advanced Data Engineering Tools**: Now we’re talking! Learn about orchestration tools like **Airflow** 🕹️, data warehousing (like **BigQuery** and **Redshift**), and **Docker** & **Kubernetes** 🐳. Yes, that’s right – we’re going hardcore! 😎
- **Stage 5: Cloud Engineering Specialization**: Time for **Infrastructure as Code** (IaC), serverless functions, and monitoring cloud systems like a pro! 🔧
- **Stage 6: Projects & Portfolio**: This is where you show off your skills! Work on real-world projects 💼 and build your **portfolio** on platforms like **Kaggle**, **GitHub**, and **Streamlit**. 🎉🎨
